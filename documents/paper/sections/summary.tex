This paper introduces the newly developed library LUtils to work with structures using different Application Binary Interfaces (ABI).
To determine whether LUtils represents a viable alternative to existing solutions in terms of execution time and memory behaviour,
several Java native access libraries were evaluated and compared – namely LWJGL, FFMA, JNA and the introduced library LUtils.
To achieve this, multiple JMH (Java Microbenchmark Harness) benchmarks were designed to evaluate the performance of structure
creation and write/read operations.
These benchmarks measure execution time as well as Java-Heap allocation rate and thereby reveal the following performance characteristics:
LWJGL demonstrated the best performance.
It is followed by FFMA which displays low execution times for small structures,
but shows decreasing performance with large and complex structures.
LUtils and especially JNA display generally lower performance, likely due to their use of Java reflection.
The evaluation revealed that LUtils should not be used in performance critical applications like real-time rendering,
because LWJGL provides up to 83 times better performance.
Possible candidates for performance critical applications include LWJGL and FFMA. However, LWJGL consistently displays
better performance than FFMA, especially when working with very large structures or when performing many write/read
operations.
